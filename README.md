Heroku

## How To Launch

Node matcher.js starts the matching engine

## FlightAware

this repo uses flightaware data > replaced with the Schiphol API
Schiphol API is restriced in number of pages, so I need to run this every couple of hours

# Schiphol Landings

This Repo now also includes the Schiphol Landings Dash

loads from schiphol_api.js on fly.io (see Dockerfile)
and schiphol_arrivals.html
